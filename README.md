# Web-application-for-managing-user-accounts
The application allows users to view, add, edit and delete user accounts.

The project consists of two main parts:

HTML structure: HTML code defines the structure of the web page, including the navigation bar (navbar) and forms for viewing, adding and editing user accounts.

JavaScript functionality: JavaScript code enables the interactivity of the web page. This includes creating a table of user accounts, switching between different views, adding new user accounts, editing existing user accounts, and deleting user accounts.

Note!!!

This project uses localStorage to store user accounts between sessions. This means that user accounts will remain saved even when the page is refreshed or closed. However, user accounts will not be saved if data from localStorage is deleted.
